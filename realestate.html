      <h1>Why private <br>real estate</h1>
      <p>Historically, private market real estate has
        <br> featured a combination of traits not found
        <br> in other asset classes: long-term earning
        <br> potential and effective diversification 
        <br>beyond the stock market.</p>

          <h1>Wealth preservation
           <br> and growth</h1>
           <p>Alternative assets like private real estate have historically offered a 
            <br>unique combination of lower volatility than stocks and higher
            <br> potential returns than bonds. This mixture can anchor your
            <br> portfolio, smoothing out the wild ups and downs of the public 
            <br>markets.</p>

          <h1>Income generation</h1>
          <p>For many investors, the ability to create consistent income—via 
            <br>equity ownership in apartment buildings or single-family rentals 
            <br>that earn income through rental payments, for instance—is one of 
            <br>the most attractive aspects of real estate investing.</p>

          <p>Private market assets are less likely to be affected by market
