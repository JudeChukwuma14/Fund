            <h1>A ONCE-IN-A-DECADE LENDING <span>ENVIRONMENT</span></h1>
            <p>
              The Federal Reserve raised interest rates at record-breaking
              speeds in 2023 in an attempt to tame inflation. This policy shift
              has destabilized markets, leading to broad dislocations, increased
              strain across the system,
              <span
                >and a potential liquidity crisis that presents a risk to the
                global economy</span
              >.
            </p>
            <p>
              Simultaneously, those factors have combined to create what we
              believe is arguably the most attractive environment for credit
              investments in a generation.

                <h1>What is private credit?</h1>
                <p>
                  Private credit (or private lending) is an asset class that
                  consists generally of loans, fixed-income, or other structured
                  investments that aim to deliver higher yields with lower
                  overall risk when compared to equity investments. In other
                  words, investors in private credit are lending money to
                  borrowers in exchange for a fixed rate of return (often
                  captured in the form of an interest rate or preferred return)
                  but typically do not have any equity ownership or upside
                  participation. Similar to other private market assets, private
                  credit differs from publicly traded credit or fixed-income
                  investments, such as bonds or asset-backed securities, because
                  it is illiquid and consequently aims to deliver a higher
                  relative return.

                <h1>The profitability of preparation</h1>
                <p>
                  As a result of the Fed's extraordinary actions, today it's
                  more expensive to borrow money for 30 days than for 30 years.
                  This is an unnatural state of affairs that we believe is
                  creating a once-in-a-decade liquidity crunch that we're
                  calling
                  <span class="odd">The Great Deleveraging</span>. <br />
                  <br />During this period, individuals and companies seeking to
                  borrow money, especially in the near term, will be forced to
                  do so at significantly more favorable terms for investors.
                  Higher interest rates will generally mean that borrowers will
                  borrow at much lower leverage (which means lower risk).
                  Virtually any loan maturing in 2023 will require a paydown,
                  and for new loans the gap between the expected and actual
                  proceeds will likely require the use of “bridge” or
                  “mezzanine” financing. <br />
                  <br />Meanwhile, investors who have been diligent and chose to
                  maintain larger cash positions over the past few years will be
                  in the enviable position of being able to demand significantly
                  more return in exchange for providing liquidity during what we
                  expect is likely to be a temporary period of realignment. <
                  >Fundrise is in that position <br /><br /><b
                    >Important Note:</b
                  >
                  In our experience, these types of unique investing
                  environments are short-lived. Accordingly, our expectation is
                  that the current period of disruption is unlikely to last
                  beyond 2024.
